<!-- blockquotes -->
I read this interesting quote the other day:

> # "Her eyes had called him and his soul had leaped at the call. To live, to err, to fall, to triumph, to recreate life out of life!"

<!-- inline code -->

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

<!-- block of code -->

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

<!-- tables -->
Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 1 is      | left-aligned  | $500  |
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes (|) are optional, and you don't need to make the 
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

Markdown | Less | Pretty

*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
